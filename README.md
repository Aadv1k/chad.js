# Chad.js

why another JavaScript library? well because there [aren't enough](https://github.com/collections/front-end-javascript-frameworks)
(PS - this is just a fun project for me to learn JavaScript, DOM and all of that good stuff, so don't get you pants in a twist just yet)

## Todo

- [ ] html manipulations
- [ ] dom manipulations
- [ ] dom element selection
- [ ] css manipulation

(def not stolen from jQuery)
